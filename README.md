# Capybara::Select2

All this gem does is something very simple- allow you to trigger select2 dropdown to select the value you want. The original select doesn't with the javascript overrides, so this new helper method does only this thing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'capybara-select2', group: :test

Or, add it into your test group

    group :test do
      gem 'capybara-select2'
      ...
    end	

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install capybara-select2

The gem automatically hook itself into rspec helper using Rspec.configure.

## Usage

Just use this method inside your capybara test:

    select2("Dropdown Text", from: "Label of the dropdown")

If the select2 field has a `min_length` option (acts as a search field) specify it with :
    
    select2("foo", from: "Label of the dropdown", search: true)
